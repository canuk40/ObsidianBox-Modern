## Introduction
ObsidianBox Modern ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application.
**The short version: We don't collect your data.**

- Personal identification information
- Device identifiers or hardware IDs
- Location data
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports (unless you explicitly share them)
- Browsing history or app usage patterns
- Contact information
- Photos, media, or files (beyond what you explicitly process through ObsidianBox commands)

## Information That Stays on Your Device
The following information is stored **locally on your device only** and is never transmitted:

We do **not** use Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or any other analytics service.
### No Ads
ObsidianBox Modern contains **no advertisements** and therefore no ad-tracking.

## Children's Privacy
ObsidianBox Modern is not directed at children under 13. The App requires technical knowledge of Linux/Unix systems and root access, making it unsuitable for children.
